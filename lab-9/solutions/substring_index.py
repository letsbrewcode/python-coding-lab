    Problem: Substring Index
    Description: You are given two strings, one is a sentence containing words
    seprated by spaces and second is searchword. Scan each word of sentence to
    check if it begins with searchword. Return the index of the word where
    searchword is prefix of word.

    If searchword is a prefix of more than one word in sentence then return the
    index of the first such word. If there are no such words then return -1.

    Example 1:
    Input: sentence = "Jupiter is the largest planet in solar system",
    searchword = "sol"
    Output: 6

    Example 2:
    Input: sentence = "This problem is an easy problem", searchword = "pro"
    Output: 1

    Example 3:
    sentence = "Jupiter is the largest planet in solar system", searchword =
    "Saturn"
    Output = -1
